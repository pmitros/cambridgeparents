<h3> Our Vision</h3>
<p>
    We are an <b>inclusive and diverse</b> coalition of parents working to <b>improve childrenâ€™s learning</b> and experience in the Cambridge Public Schools. We seek to build a <b>strong, united</b> parent community by informing, empowering and activating parents and caregivers across Cambridge. We will engage with teachers, the school administration, the School Committee and other interested parties to <b>create change</b>.
</p>

<h3>What Is It?</h4>
<p>Parents from around the district are planning a one-day Parent Summit on Saturday, May 12th at the Fletcher-Maynard Academy school with free childcare and lunch.  </p>

We're in the process of figuring out the agenda.  We'll have topical discussions around issues that parents care about the most, workshops on parent rights and advocacy, and more. 

<h3>Why Is This Happening?</h3>
We hope to connect parents to discuss top issues, build community, and organize for positive change. By building a strong and united parent coalition, we will give parents a voice that will help advocate change. 

<h3>Who Is Involved?</h3>
<p>This parent summit is being organized by a diverse group of  parents from different schools, for participation by all Cambridge parents and caregivers interested in our public schools.</p>

<h3>Are You Inviting Any Teachers or School Representatives?</h3>
<p>As stated in our mission, we're committed to engaging with teachers, the school administration, the School Committee and other interested parties to create change, and are already talking to district and city representatives. </p>

<p>We're planning to have a closing session for the summit 3-4pm, and invite teachers, school & district administrators, school committee members, teachers, family liaisons and other interested members of the community to come join  us.</p>

<p>If you know a teacher, administrator, or educator that would be interested in this, <a href="mailto:psummit@mg.yana.com">let us know</a> or feel free to tell them about this event. </p>

<h3>How Did This Come About?</h3>
<p>
On October 30, 2017, representatives from parent organizations of 15 different Cambridge public schools met for a two-hour meeting. At this grassroots event, we swapped ideas about parent communications and fund-raising and discussed concerns about parent engagement in our schools. All the School Committee candidates were invited and most attended. 
</p>

<p>
It was by all counts a successful event. We all left highly energized.  A sub-group of parents inspired by the October event have begun organizing for a new reason: to create a district-wide Parent Summit, so we can continue and expand our conversation, to issues that concern all the parents in the district.
</p>

<h3>How Will Action Take Place?</h3>
<p>
At the Parent Summit, we will gather several key issues of most interest and create a preliminary plan for change. Our goal -- a strong and united parent coalition will then engage with teachers, school administration, School Committee, and other interested parties to implement change.
