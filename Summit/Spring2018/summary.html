<h3>May 2018 Parent Summit Recap</h3>
<p>The Parent Summit happened on May 12th, 2018 and was a great success! 
Big thanks to everyone who came.
<ul>
  <li><b>150 parents</b> came to talk about what's top of their mind for our Public Schools. </li> 
  <li>All <b>17 Cambridge Public Schools</b> were represented, plus parents of kids in preschools and others. </li> 
  <li>The <b>superintendent</b>, the <b>mayor</b>, the <b>school committee</b>, and the state rep came to hear the discussion summary, which was covered by CCTV.</li>
  <li>One of the highlights for many attendees was the <b>Parents of Color</b> chat. </li>
    <ul>
    <li>Ethnicity/Race represented includes African American / Black, Latino, Chicana,
        Haitian, Multi-Racial,  East Indian, South East Asian, Chinese, Filipina, Laotian,
        Native American, and Cape Verdean.
    </li>
    </ul>
  <li>We have <b>eight topical working groups</b> on Achievement / Opportunity Gap to Upper Schools to Social Emotional Learning.</li>
  <li>We now have <b>over 200</b> parents on our mailing list, many subscribed to one of the working groups, e.g. Parents of Color with 55 parents.</li>
  <li>About <b>half</b> of the parents who attended the summit expressed interest in joining a <b>Parent Coalition</b> to move this work forward.</li>
</ul>

<p>

  <br/>
  Parents' Interest in Topics
</center>
</p>


<p>The goal of the summit was to activate and connect people. It gave parents a taste of working together on voicing thoughts, and brainstorming actions.</p>

<p>If you find the summary notes below interesting, and would like to keep the conversation going and work on taking them from raw ideas to actionable recommendations (by working with stakeholders),  come to the <a href="/">June 11th Next Steps Meeting</a> and <b>join the 9 Working Groups</b>! </p>

<h3>Summary Notes</h3>
<p>Below is a summary of the discussions at the summit.</p>
<ul>
<li> They come mostly from the independent facilitator’s notes, with some additional info from note takers or easel notes (when facilitator’s notes lack sufficient details). They’ve only been summarized for readability. </li>
<li> These should <b>NOT be taken as final recommendations</b> from the summit but as snapshots of <b>parent voice</b> (and as such, they may not agree. :)</li>
<li>Additional raw, unsummarized (easel board notes, volunteer notes, etc.) will be available separately.</li>
<li>Use them to get a sense of the conversations at the Parent Summit for those who missed the summit or couldn’t attend a session, and to stimulate your own ideas and discussions. And come join us June 11th to move to action!</li>
